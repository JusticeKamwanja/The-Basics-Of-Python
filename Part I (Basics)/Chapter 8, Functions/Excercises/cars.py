# Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary.
# The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
# It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
# Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
# such as a color or an optional feature.
# Your function should work for a call like this one:
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
