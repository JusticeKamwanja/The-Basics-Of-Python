# Make a class called User.

# Create two attributes called first_name and last_name,

# Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information.

# Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user.

# Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.
