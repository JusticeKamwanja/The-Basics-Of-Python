# Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166).
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0.
# Create an instance called restaurant from this class.
# Print the number of customers the restaurant has served,
# and then change this value and print it again.
# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
# of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new numberand print the value again.
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served.
# Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.
